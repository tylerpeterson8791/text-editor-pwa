# Text Editor - PWA

  ## Description
  
  My motivation for this project was to finish creating a back end for a PWA site.
  My personal motivation was to get more comfortable PWA's and learn the process for deploying and initiating them.
  
  ## Installation

  We were provided starter code by our professor Gary.  There were four "To-Do" files in the project.  First I had to complete the src-sw.js file.  This is the part of the app that deals with the caching strategy.

  Next I completed the webpack.config.js file.  Here we brought in a few different webpacks and defined the "rules" for them.

  Next was to complete the database.js file.  This file deals with IndexedDB and how to take updated content and store it there.
  
  Finally I finished the install.js file.  This deals with the logic of how and when to install the PWA functionality of the site.

  ## Usage
  
  The user is greeted with a simple text editor upon visiting the site:

  There is an option on the top bar to install JATE to use when offline:

  ## Credits

  This challenge was a great way to get some hands on experience with PWAs.  These are a super cool hybrid with some amazing back-end synching technology

  I only used class notes and lessons for reference on this one so I have no outside sources to credit besides our instructor Gary (who provided the starter code and gave us a great walkthrough) and our TA Katy (who taught the lesson initially).
